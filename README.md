# Konami Mobile Ripping Toolset

![kagemasa](misc/kagemasa.png)

A set of tools for ripping music from Konami mobile games


## Contents

- **nigger.py** for niggering konami's website, ripping all remote assets 
- **fuck.py** for fucking encryption on assets
- **fuck.cs** for fucking encryption on other files (static assets)
- **cum.py** for gluing artwork, titles and music together

## Support

Only tested on jubeat

## How to use
These scripts are not user friendly and meant to be adjusted based on specific game you are trying to rip music from. 

You will need some reverse engineering and programming knowledge to use them.

- Dump the game files from `/sdcard/Android/data/com.konami.*`
- Grab ablist from `com.konami.*/files/ab/ablist.json`
- Run `fuck.py` to decrypt ablist.json
- Run `nigger.py` to dump remote assets
- Run `fuck.cs` to decrypt music metadata `com.konami.*/files/Play/MusicList`
- Run Assets Studio and dump decrypted game assets
- Run `cum.py` to glue decrypted assets (arts and music) with music metadata (titles and artists)

## Technicals/Structure

- Overview on AssetBundleCryptoStream encryption [https://jywhy6.zone/2019/12/21/decrypt-bm2dxum/](https://jywhy6.zone/2019/12/21/decrypt-bm2dxum/)

- Static assets are decrypted using fuck.cs with a hardcoded key/iv

- Original file path (bundlePath) is used for both salt and password 
- PBKDF1 used for derivation [(C# implementation)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.passwordderivebytes?view=net-5.0) the C# implementation is out of spec and allows salts of arbitrary lengths!
- AES-128-ECB is used for implementing custom AES-CTR mode. Block counter is used for CTR nonce
- Assets are distributed encrypted via amazon storage instance `http://d3u9qu1rz2zw6v.cloudfront.net/`
- `/sdcard/Android/data/com.konami.android.jubeat/files/ab/ablist.json` - stores list of assets and their original paths (encrypted)
